# Destiny Deploy Log

No release is valid unless its entry is complete and the green gate belongs to the exact shipped SHA. A release entry containing `TBD`, `pending`, or an empty field is a hard stop.

## Required release-entry template

Copy this commented template for each release. Remove the comment markers only after every field has verified evidence.

- Status: evidence only; this is not a shipped release entry

## CTO governance decision: GOV-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- decision record: https://claude.ai/chat/1eed0b57-2045-4cdc-a738-df1c67dcdbdc
- scope: authorize implementation of the durable Destiny harness-governance system on a protected branch and PR
- decision: create one canonical root `HARNESS_POLICY.md`; add thin root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` pointers; add the `destiny-harness` project skill and cloud knowledge pointer; enforce classification, frozen paths, evidence, and completion rules in GitHub Actions; validate the GOV-1 test matrix before claiming completion
- frozen actions retained: no Supabase Auth Site URL change, Replit modification or decommissioning, database migration, wrapper merge to `main`, or new `container-staging` push without a new recorded Fable 5 High decision
- implementation branch: `codex/destiny-governance-gov-1`
- production effect: none authorized; governance implementation only

## CTO governance decision: D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- triggering evidence: post-merge `main` harness https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/actions/runs/32651315235 failed at merge SHA `2c62a5b364385565d484935ab4b76679779a4c12` because GitHub's protected squash subject did not use a TDD commit prefix
- classification: HIGH enforcement-script repair under GOV-1
- binding rule: commit-shape and TDD-prefix validation applies only to commits that are not reachable from the protected remote `origin/main`; commits already reachable from protected `origin/main` are exempt because their constituent PR commits were checked before squash merge
- fail-closed rule: the gate must fail with a clear error if `origin/main` cannot be resolved; no subject-pattern allowlist or GitHub API dependency is permitted
- invariant rules: forbidden-test-marker scanning, `commit-policy.json` immutability, activation checks, and strict validation for commits outside protected `origin/main` remain unchanged
- authorized files: `destiny-product/scripts/qa-commit-policy.mjs`, a focused commit-policy test file, this deploy-log entry, and only if required a minimal workflow fetch-depth or `origin/main` ref fix
- forbidden shortcuts: no history rewrite, force push, admin bypass, branch-protection weakening, `commit-policy.json` edit, soft-failed gate, or `HARNESS_POLICY.md` edit
- required sequence: decision record, RED tests, GREEN implementation, protected HIGH PR with `cto-approved`, all three required checks, protected squash merge, and a green post-merge `main` harness at the repair merge SHA
- rollback: revert-by-PR through the same protected path; no direct edit, tag, production change, or history rewrite

## CTO governance decision: D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-2

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- classification: HIGH enforcement-script amendment to D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1
- triggering evidence: the canonical local clone uses `github/main` for `git@github.com:joseangelo510/destiny.git`, while its non-canonical local `origin` has no `origin/main`; a remote-name-only rule failed closed locally and could trust a spoofed `origin` later
- binding rule: select only `origin` or `github`, in that order, and only when its normalized URL exactly identifies `joseangelo510/destiny` and its full `refs/remotes/<name>/main` ref resolves
- accepted canonical URL identities: HTTPS, SCP-style SSH, or `ssh://` forms for `github.com/joseangelo510/destiny`, with at most one trailing slash and one optional `.git` suffix removed before exact comparison
- fail-closed rule: if neither candidate has both canonical URL identity and a remote-tracking `main` ref, stop with diagnostics for both candidates; never trust a remote name, local branch, `HEAD`, network lookup, regex substring, or configuration override
- required evidence: offline temporary-repository tests for CI and canonical-clone layouts, spoofed remotes, absent refs, URL normalization and near misses, local-branch spoofing, no-network operation, plus the D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1 reachability regressions
- authorized files: `destiny-product/scripts/qa-commit-policy.mjs`, focused commit-policy tests, and this deploy-log entry only
- completion and rollback: retain every protected PR, `cto-approved`, three-check, post-merge `main` harness, and revert-by-PR requirement from D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1

## CTO governance decision: D-HARNESS-PHASE-COMPLETE-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- classification: HIGH governance stage-gate under GOV-1
- verified evidence: active ruleset `Destiny protected main` at https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/settings/rules/21242085 has no bypass actors and requires `harness-gates`, `policy-guard`, and `checklist-guard`; protected repair PR https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/pull/10 merged at `932425eff975e30b5652828c2baef8cc35103030`; the exact-SHA post-merge harness passed at https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/actions/runs/32652674102
- decision: GO; the harness phase is complete at `932425eff975e30b5652828c2baef8cc35103030`, and MEDIUM product work is authorized under GOV-1
- mandatory product lane: UX, copy, ordinary features, safe refactors, tests, and non-governance documentation must continue through branch, classification, full `pnpm gate`, protected PR, and the three required checks; ambiguity still defaults to HIGH
- ongoing non-blocking harness work: monitor gate runtime and flakiness, add Playwright coverage with each feature, periodically check GitHub rules and workflow-policy drift, keep patch and minor dependencies current through the MEDIUM lane, and record newly observed edge cases rather than speculatively delaying product work
- next product priorities: improve the core journey from sign-in to first delivered value; ship one evidence-led flagship feature end to end with its Playwright journey; prepare `app.caminoseo.com` launch readiness without performing the frozen cutover
- frozen actions retained: no Supabase Auth Site URL change, Replit production modification or decommissioning, database migration, release-wrapper merge, new `container-staging` push, traffic redirect, auth or RLS change, release tag, or production or parallel-launch change without a new recorded Fable 5 High decision
- implementation scope: this deploy-log decision record only; no product, customer-data, staging, or production mutation is authorized
- completion and rollback: merge this record through a protected HIGH PR with `cto-approved`, all three required checks, and a green post-merge `main` harness; rollback only by protected revert PR

## CTO product decision: D-MVP-CERTIFICATION-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction; Jose approved proceeding after reviewing the 20-feature MVP implementation audit
- decision record: https://claude.ai/chat/96ea1beb-bf62-49f8-88b7-6596cb98cbfa
- classification: HIGH product-certification program under GOV-1 because the approved scope includes Google OAuth property binding and Supabase-backed publication state
- decision: stop expanding the MVP feature set and certify one narrow WordPress vertical slice in this order: enforce the keyword-quality gate; establish one canonical publication receipt; prove reviewed article delivery to a WordPress draft and later live verification; restrict This Week to certified actions; reconcile the in-app weekly report to rank observations; and make Google Search Console and Analytics property selection explicit, site-bound, and fail closed
- authorized implementation: TDD changes to ordinary product code, tests, Playwright journeys, Google sync/property-selection logic, and existing Supabase-backed integration/publication records needed for the certified slice; the implementation must reuse the current schema and current OAuth scopes, store no secret values, and preserve organization and website isolation
- authorized external verification: existing staging pipeline and non-production controlled test properties/sites only; no customer production publish, email send, social post, billing change, or public traffic change is authorized by this record
- frozen actions not authorized: no database migration, Supabase Auth Site URL change, auth/RLS/security-model change, secret or provider-credential mutation, Replit production change, `container-staging` push outside the existing pipeline, traffic redirect, production or parallel-launch deploy, release-wrapper merge, or release-tag creation
- implementation branch: `codex/destiny-mvp-certification-v1`, branched from protected `github/main` merge SHA `d69f072262730d2cc976825155f8cf3b88524a4a`
- mandatory evidence: separate RED and GREEN commits; full `pnpm gate`; exact-SHA staging build stamp; zero-5xx checks for touched routes; two-property Google isolation proof; one WordPress Draft Delivered to Live Verified journey; adversarial keyword-quality corpus; and required `policy-guard`, `checklist-guard`, and `harness-gates` checks
- pull-request control: the HIGH PR requires the `cto-approved` label applied by `joseangelo510`; no actor may substitute for Jose or weaken this requirement
- completion rule: this program is not complete until the protected PR is merged, all required checks are green for the merge SHA, and the completion report contains the PR URL, merge SHA, and check-run URLs
- rollback: protected revert PR only; no direct production edit, history rewrite, migration rollback, tag mutation, or admin bypass

## CTO product decision: D-MVP-CERTIFICATION-2

2026-08-24 | D-MVP-CERTIFICATION-2 | HIGH | CONDITIONAL GO | Issued by: Fable 5 High (Destiny CTO, HARNESS_POLICY.md GOV-1)

## CTO governance decision: D-MVP-RECOVERY-1B

[2026-08-24] D-MVP-RECOVERY-1B
Second gate amendment to D-MVP-RECOVERY-1. PR #13, head a95058fac3d1bc6dbbbc0770de49268f8cbf50ac before amendment.
Gate at a95058f: repo policy, commit policy, deploy log policy, inventory, migrations, dependency audit, lint passed. Vitest failed.
Failure 1: route-auth-census rejected src/app/api/version/route.ts. Decision: GO, path 13 authorized, one allowlist entry with written justification, no logic change.
Failure 2: two commit-policy-canonical-main-ref tests timed out at 5s, no assertion failure. Decision: no file change, one unchanged rerun, CI harness authoritative, halt if repeated.
Sequence: PR body amended to 13 paths, test-change: commit (census test only), green: commit (decision + log only), full gate once, CI run.
Mutations: none. Publish/schedule/social: still halted. P1 still NO GO until deploy and /api/version verification.
Decided by: Destiny CTO under HARNESS_POLICY.md GOV-1

## CTO governance decision: D-MVP-RECOVERY-1A

[2026-08-24] D-MVP-RECOVERY-1A
Scope amendment to D-MVP-RECOVERY-1. PR #13.
RED: 030b646 (failed correctly, /api/version absent). GREEN: 4181bed (four focused tests pass).
Gate: qa:inventory regenerated destiny-product/qa/inventory/routes.json (+5 lines, /api/version registration). No other changes.
Decision: path 12 authorized, generated only, new commit after 4181bed, PR description amended before commit.
Mutations: none. Publish/schedule/social: still halted. P1 still NO GO until deploy and /api/version verification.
Decided by: Destiny CTO under HARNESS_POLICY.md GOV-1

## CTO governance decision: D-MVP-RECOVERY-1C

[2026-08-24] D-MVP-RECOVERY-1C
Classification: HIGH. Decision: GO for the exact seven paths recorded in `docs/releases/D-MVP-RECOVERY-1/FABLE_HIGH_DECISION.md`; no expansion.
Trigger: Republish of deployment a5e94a27 initiated at T0 2026-08-24T19:03:27Z from detached M2 `d0c302cf1d0e52207b9154b37ec8728ea6d792fc`, tree `28daab7097aa56dcbe50e42389a8142b8b1937cd`, with clean status.
Classification: LIVE, UNPROVEN, M2 BY RECEIPT. Replit publish status reports success, but no build record later than T0 appears in deployment history and unauthenticated `GET /api/version` returns `401`.
Publish record: Replit publish commit `961bca1eec332a43a617aadb2e9b4246f73c8218` (parent M2, tree `28daab7097aa56dcbe50e42389a8142b8b1937cd`, 2026-08-24T19:21:17Z), preserved by local-only tag `receipt/replit-publish-961bca1`. Publish status API: success, deployment a5e94a27. Build record after T0: none observed.
Environment drift: `qgit` was added to ignored, untracked `replit.nix` through a Replit Nix prompt during pager recovery. No tracked repository content changed; the file was not reverted; no deployment impact is expected.
Required change: make the build stamp an explicit part of `build`, emit deterministic provenance evidence, and expose exact GET-only `/api/version` before authentication while keeping every other protected API and method blocked.
Mutations: none. Publish/schedule/social: halted. P1 remains NO GO until the future M3 deployment has a post-trigger build log with matching runtime provenance.
