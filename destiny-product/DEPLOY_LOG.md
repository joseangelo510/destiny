# Destiny Deploy Log

No release is valid unless its entry is complete and the green gate belongs to the exact shipped SHA. A release entry containing `TBD`, `pending`, or an empty field is a hard stop.

## Required release-entry template

Copy this commented template for each release. Remove the comment markers only after every field has verified evidence.

```text
## Release: <name>
- date: <ISO date and time>
- shipped commit SHA: <full SHA>
- tag: <immutable tag>
- PR links: <one or more URLs>
- gate run link: <green run URL for shipped SHA>
- summary counts: <test files, tests, browser journeys>
- RED evidence links: <one failing run per new RED test group>
- commit discipline: <pass and policy version>
- isolation matrix: <pass and fixture summary>
- test-change: <none, or commit plus justification>
- migrations: <IDs, or explicit none>
- features and blast radius: <feature map names and blast radius>
- rollback command: <exact non-destructive rollback command>
- deployer: <person or automation>
- post-deploy smoke: <run URL and result>
- legacy-evidence: <pre-policy TDD pairs and GitHub runs; required for PR #7 only>
```

## Pre-release Step Zero evidence

- Draft PR: https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/pull/7
- Last fully green pre-policy gate: https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/actions/runs/32560700136
- Pre-policy counts: 155 Vitest files, 1,064 tests, 10 authenticated/public desktop and mobile browser journeys
- Status: evidence only; this is not a shipped release entry

## CTO governance decision: GOV-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- decision record: https://claude.ai/chat/1eed0b57-2045-4cdc-a738-df1c67dcdbdc
- scope: authorize implementation of the durable Destiny harness-governance system on a protected branch and PR
- decision: create one canonical root `HARNESS_POLICY.md`; add thin root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` pointers; add the `destiny-harness` project skill and cloud knowledge pointer; enforce classification, frozen paths, evidence, and completion rules in GitHub Actions; validate the GOV-1 test matrix before claiming completion
- frozen actions retained: no Supabase Auth Site URL change, Replit modification or decommissioning, database migration, wrapper merge to `main`, or new `container-staging` push without a new recorded Fable 5 High decision
- implementation branch: `codex/destiny-governance-gov-1`
- production effect: none authorized; governance implementation only

## CTO governance decision: D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- triggering evidence: post-merge `main` harness https://github.com/joseangelo510/destiny/actions/runs/32651315235 failed at merge SHA `2c62a5b364385565d484935ab4b76679779a4c12` because GitHub's protected squash subject did not use a TDD commit prefix
- classification: HIGH enforcement-script repair under GOV-1
- binding rule: commit-shape and TDD-prefix validation applies only to commits that are not reachable from the protected remote `origin/main`; commits already reachable from protected `origin/main` are exempt because their constituent PR commits were checked before squash merge
- fail-closed rule: the gate must fail with a clear error if `origin/main` cannot be resolved; no subject-pattern allowlist or GitHub API dependency is permitted
- invariant rules: forbidden-test-marker scanning, `commit-policy.json` immutability, activation checks, and strict validation for commits outside protected `origin/main` remain unchanged
- authorized files: `destiny-product/scripts/qa-commit-policy.mjs`, a focused commit-policy test file, this deploy-log entry, and only if required a minimal workflow fetch-depth or `origin/main` ref fix
- forbidden shortcuts: no history rewrite, force push, admin bypass, branch-protection weakening, `commit-policy.json` edit, soft-failed gate, or `HARNESS_POLICY.md` edit
- required sequence: decision record, RED tests, GREEN implementation, protected HIGH PR with `cto-approved`, all three required checks, protected squash merge, and a green post-merge `main` harness at the repair merge SHA
- rollback: revert-by-PR through the same protected path; no direct edit, tag, production change, or history rewrite

## CTO governance decision: D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-2

- date: 2026-08-23
- deciding authority: Fable 5 High, acting as Destiny CTO at Jose Gallegos's direction
- classification: HIGH enforcement-script amendment to D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1
- triggering evidence: the canonical local clone uses `github/main` for `git@github.com:joseangelo510/destiny.git`, while its non-canonical local `origin` has no `origin/main`; a remote-name-only rule failed closed locally and could trust a spoofed `origin` later
- binding rule: select only `origin` or `github`, in that order, and only when its normalized URL exactly identifies `joseangelo510/destiny` and its full `refs/remotes/<name>/main` ref resolves
- accepted canonical URL identities: HTTPS, SCP-style SSH, or `ssh://` forms for `github.com/joseangelo510/destiny`, with at most one trailing slash and one optional `.git` suffix removed before exact comparison
- fail-closed rule: if neither candidate has both canonical URL identity and a remote-tracking `main` ref, stop with diagnostics for both candidates; never trust a remote name, local branch, `HEAD`, network lookup, regex substring, or configuration override
- required evidence: offline temporary-repository tests for CI and canonical-clone layouts, spoofed remotes, absent refs, URL normalization and near misses, local-branch spoofing, no-network operation, plus the D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1 reachability regressions
- authorized files: `destiny-product/scripts/qa-commit-policy.mjs`, focused commit-policy tests, and this deploy-log entry only
- completion and rollback: retain every protected PR, `cto-approved`, three-check, post-merge `main` harness, and revert-by-PR requirement from D-SQUASH-EXEMPT-1
